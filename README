THE SALES PITCH

    Pan is good for Reading News.

        * Pan is the only Unix newsreader to score 100% on the
          Good Net-Keeping Seal of Approval newsreader evaluations.
        * Pan has keyboard bindings for mouse-free newsreading.
        * Basic newsreader features, such as reading and writing news,
          threading articles, and replying via email, are supported.
        * Articles can be sorted by author, date, subject, or the number
          of unread children in the thread.
        * Multiple connections are supported, so articles can be read
          while binaries are downloading.
        * Articles can be filtered by regular expression matching,
          read/unread state, binary/text, etc.
        * Works well as an offline reader.
        * Articles can be queued until you want to go online, and can be
          re-edited at any point before they're posted.
        * A flexible rules system allows you to delete, hide, download,
          or notify you of, etc. articles that match a subject, or are
          posted by a particular user, and so on.
        * The same system can be used to define automatic actions on behalf
          of the user: auto-download, auto-cache, auto-delete etc.
        * Groups can be filtered by regular expression matching
          subscribed/new/all, etc.

    Pan is good for Downloading Binaries.

        * Attached images can be shown inline.
        * Pan can download and thread articles as quickly as bandwidth allows.
        * uuencoded, mime, and yEnc attachments are all supported.
        * A task manager lets you reorder, cancel, and resubmit download tasks.
        * Multiple connections are supported, so many binaries can
          be downloaded simultaneously.
        * Multipart articles are automatically grouped together.
        * Non-binary, incomplete multipart, and saved messages can be filtered
          out of the article list.

    Pan is good for Uploading Content to Usenet.

        * Files can be attached to a Usenet article and are
          automatically yEnc-encrypted, threaded and referenced by Pan.
        * Articles can be encrypted and/or signed with a public/private PGP key,
          so your privacy and security are ensured.
        * Connections can be encrypted with the TLS 1.0 protocol (the successor
          to SSL 3.0).
