    This is Pan, a powerful and user-friendly USENET newsreader for GTK+.
    The latest info and versions of Pan can always be found at
    <http://pan.rebelbase.com/>.

REQUIREMENTS

    Pan requires these libraries:
    * GTK+ 2.16.0 or higher (optionally GTK+ 3.0.0 or higher) <http://www.gtk.org/>
    * gmime 2.6.0 or higher <http://spruce.sourceforge.net/gmime/>

    Spellchecking requires the following library:
    * gtkspell 2.0.7 or higher <http://gtkspell.sourceforge.net>

    There are other libraries available that pan uses for enhancements:
    * Libnotify (0.4.1)
    * Gnome-Keyring (3.2.2)
    * DBUS

    Most Linux distributions already have these; they can also be 
    downloaded from their home pages or installed via packet managers.
    In Debian-based systems (for example Ubuntu) this can be done
    in a terminal with '(sudo) apt-get install LIBRARY_NAME'.
    In Arch, there's pacman etc....

THE SALES PITCH

    Pan is good for Reading News.

        * Pan is the only Unix newsreader to score 100% on the
          Good Net-Keeping Seal of Approval newsreader evaluations.
        * Pan has keyboard bindings for mouse-free newsreading.
        * Basic newsreader features, such as reading and writing news,
          threading articles, and replying via email, are supported.
        * Articles can be sorted by author, date, subject, or the number
          of unread children in the thread.
        * Multiple connections are supported, so articles can be read
          while binaries are downloading.
        * Articles can be filtered by regular expression matching,
          read/unread state, binary/text, etc.
        * Works well as an offline reader.
        * Posts can be queued until you want to go online, and can be
          re-edited at any point before they're sent.
        * Pan saves your posted messages in a folder for future reference.
        * A flexible rules system allows you to delete, hide, download,
          or notify you of, etc. articles that match a subject, or are
          posted by a particular user, and so on.
        * Groups can be filtered by regular expression matching
          subscribed/new/all, etc.

    Pan is good for Downloading Binaries.

        * Attached images can be shown inline.
        * Pan can download and thread articles as quickly as bandwidth allows.
        * uuencoded, mime, and yEnc attachments are all supported.
        * A task manager lets you reorder, cancel, and resubmit download tasks.
        * Multiple connections are supported, so many binaries can
          be downloaded simultaneously.
        * Multipart articles are automatically grouped together.
        * Non-binary, incomplete multipart, and saved messages can be filtered
          out of the article list.

    
    Pan is good for Uploading Content to Usenet
        * Files can be attached to a Usenet post and are
          automatically yEnc-encrypted, threaded and referenced by pan.
        * Posts can be encrypted and/or signed with a public/private PGP key,
          so your privacy and security are ensured.
        * Connections can be encrypted with secure SSL 3.0 connections.
