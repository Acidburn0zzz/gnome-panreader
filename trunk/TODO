    When using the article filter in a  news group, it would be nice if
    there could be a .not. or invert button somewhere. So if the filter is
    "Banana", then I'd like to be able to hit the button and select all the
    articles (so I can delete them or mark them read) that DON'T have Banana
    in there...

    1) When in a thread and you press minus several times the thread should
    continue collapsing until at the 'root' of the thread. It's a pain to
    have to move to a part of the thread for collapsing it further.

    6) Ignoring a thread Pan should automatically move to the next unread  
    thread/message.

    12) Maybe I didn't look close enough but I can't find a purging
    mechanism!?

    1. Steps to reproduce:
    Select a thread which has several replies. Press the [+] button on
    the left of it. Select one of the early replies and press on
    [+] again to close the thread.
    Result:
    In the thread (header) pane the cursor will be on a line which is         
    (number of replies - number of previously selected reply)       
    higher than the thread where it was opened.

    Yesterday I opened a group and tagged the
    first 3 files at the top of the list. I inadvertantly also had the "minus
    sign - book pic - name of group" at the top of the article pane selected. I
    pressed SHIFT-S and nothing. I did so a few times before realizing I had the
    group name selected also. No biggie, just might confuse someone...

    For example, I just posted to nz.test and aus.test (nz.test; aus.test).
    If I follow up to nz.test then the cross-posting works.
    However if I follow up to aus.test then I am only posting to aus.test.
    This is a verified problem. There also appears to be an issue where
    replies to a cross-post are only seen in one of the newsgroups.

[ ] Jordan Nelson (pan-users)
    It would be very helpful if you could configure Pan to run a system call
    (like a perl script or something) with the filename of the just-decoded
    file as the first argument.  This could allow for doing whatever you want
    to a file, such as automatically sorting it, logging it to a database,
    etc.  Am I making any sense?

[ ] Paul Smith <ozric99.nospam@lineone.net>
    I've selected the "use single click preview" option but am not getting
    the effect I'd like.  I'd like to press N to go to the next unread
    message and display it in the preview pane similar to pressing Ctrl-U in
    Outlook Express, but I still seem to have to actually click on the
    message in the thread pane to display it in the preview pane.  Is there
    something I'm doing wrong?  Apologies if I've missed something obvious.                         

[ ] When you go back to the articles tab from the message tab, the
    view is down at the bottom of the window instead of up at the
    current article, where it should be.

[ ] Martin Cosgrave <martian@marsbard.com>
    It would be nice to have some sort of bandwidth limitation; since the
    news server is usually the closest thing it seems to get high bitrates
    at the expense of other more distant services.

    Decode a random group of articles selected by user

[ ] Doug Palmer <doug@charvolant.org>
    And for a difficult one. Is it possible to set up a rule action which says
    'delete/mark as read this article and all the followups to this article
    (or depth-n followups)'? This would be very useful in conjunction with a
    spam/bozo filter. There are certain bozos that post in such a way as to
    almost guarantee that the replies spiral into a mess of off-topic flaming.
    Actually, depth-n followups would probably be the most useful, as things
    settle down after a while; setting it to depth-1 would take care of most
    problems. It wouldn't matter too much if this action gets things wrong
    from time to time, as articles expire. But it would save a lot of pruning
    time on potentially interesting megathreads.

[ ] Spoiler
    Some time ago I implemented spoiler-support for pan, it's easy
    enough - when you encounter "^L" (control-l, formfeed), you "mute"
    the following text - you can copy most of the code from the
    mute-quoted-text routine.  It's common in all newsgroups discussing
    tv-shows for example. 

[ ] Cross-posted articles
    If I read article x in group y and it was xposted to group z, then 
    ant tit to be marked read when I enter group z.  I know this requires
    database-synching of the different groups which, probably, is a PITA,
    but it's really neat.  Maybe one could do this through a filter?
    mark read if article was already read in other group or something?

[ ] "Dan Stromberg" <strombrg@nis.acs.uci.edu> 
    Is there a way of piping an article through a filter?  trn does this
    with the "|" command - I've found it really useful.  Even better than
    that would be if there were a way of configuring pan so you have a
    configurable button you can click that you've preassociated a command
    with, that'll do the pipe without having to type the command each time.
    I'm particularly interested in this so that I can pipe the ascii diagrams
    in rec.games.go to a filter that makes the diagrams more presentable.
    But this could also be helpful with unsharing source code and such too.

[ ] Convenient jumping from one newsgroup to another from a post's newsgroups
    header (ie, viewing a crossposted message thread in all it's newsgroups)

[ ] replace ^I with spaces when posting a message to skip tab damage

[ ] I'd like to select the whole text of the message (like ctrl-a in (Francesco)

[ ] For the newsgroup list pane, I find it irritating to have to set the
    properties for each of the groups I subscribe, I rather liked Agent's way
    of setting default properties for all of the subscribed newsgroups, and
    being able to 'adjust' using the property for a particular newsgroup to
    override the default properties.

[ ] Andreas Scherbaum <ads@htl.de>
    And another thing, more a feature request: is it possible to get
    a window to fetch a single message from server with a given
    message-id? Most references to other articles coming this way
    so it would be nice to give pan the message id and it will
    fetch the message from the news server and display it.

    Date/time is an option I like to have available, though, since I use
    Netscape to read the same groups at work and know what time I'm caught
    up through on the two servers I use most...
    (Analysis: plugging in date/time into a rule and saving the rule to
    have to apply it would be annoying; better to have the 'apply' button
    let the user fill in fields somehow)

[ ] Jason Baietto <jason@metrolink.com>
    I absolutely love pan, but I have a minor feature request.
    Can you add resettable per-server download counters so that
    I can keep track of how many megabytes I've downloaded from
    a given server?  Pan makes it so easy to download stuff that
    I've exceeded my nntp provider's limits twice now.
    Thanks in advance and thanks for a terrific product.

[ ] Matthew Lenz <hohlraum@nocturnal.org>
    i dunno how newshark does this, but it associates a 'life' percentage
    to articles and gives you an idea as to how much longer a specific article
    (or binary post cluster) will be around before being dropped from the
    server.  It also lets you sort by this percentage in the download pane.
    (so you can be sure to download the oldest article first)

[ ] Matthew Lenz <hohlraum@nocturnal.org>
    preview a binary attachment.  (for example only download and decode the
    first N number of parts and then launch in associated viewer.)

[ ] Add support for SSL. <http://www.moxienet.com/lynx/> has patches for SLL
    support in Lynx, which points the way pretty nicely.  (Note to users:
    I need an account on an SSL news server;  please mail charles@superpimp.org
    if you can provide one for testing.)

    Shortcut to edit a message in pan.sendlater, possibly 'e'

[ ] search headers from multiple groups

[ ] delete old articles as a group grows to larger than N articles

[ ] pan-users: single-click to open all threads  (>2x)

[ ] pan-users: extern app to pass messages through before they're posted.
